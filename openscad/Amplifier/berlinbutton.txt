Slicing this with cura doesn't generate supports. 
And I tried hard. 
Problem is that the brim in this object needs a support.
When one looks at it under the microscope the first and even second and third layer are off at the corner they start at.
Cura just refuses to generate a support.
There is a 2-3 layer hang. not good!
