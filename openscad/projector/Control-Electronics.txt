This is for a motorized projector screen (3m wide).

.The motor used is a:
* 60KTYZ 220VAC 15RPM chinese motor

.The existing electronics (controls) are:
* A bit dated
* An ugly rectangular box of semi transparent hard plastic
* Repaired (220V side needed resoldering)
* Only have an IR remote control (that doesn't work)
* Have yanky up/stop/down keys that are not very:
** responsive
** nice
** tactile
** etc
* An ugly shade of cream
* have a nasty red LED thats always on
* are Always on
* and have a few other niggling cosmetic issues that would make a designer get sick in a bucket
* Are in general just shy of rip and replace by a hair's width

The screen is on an axle that is rotated by the motor. 
The axle also rotates a lead screw that moves a plastic card left or right.
The card depresses either a left or right micro switch that cuts power for that direction.
Both end stops can be adjusted individually.
The electronics have NO knowledge of the state and instead just turn on the up or down power for a period of time.
The period of time is greater than the time to travel the distance between the end-stops.

.The new controls have:
* Two triple position toggle switches (220VAC)
** Auto/OFF/Manual
** Up/stop/down (when set to manual)
* An ESP32 with wifi and two relays
** One for controls power (NO/NC) that sequentially connects to the other 
*** That turns the motor left or right (NO/NC)
* optionally a status neo pixel for when in wifi mode (will bother)
* optionally a mini Oled (might not bother)

The aim is that the new controls are placed right next to the screen and allow manual OR networked control.
The manual control requires either a long arm or a stick (and this is by design as it's considered not the normal mode).
The wifi connexion is primarily MQTT.
The remote is through MQTT with an option of a web page... that may or may not materialize.

The initial housing is JUST for testing without getting electrocuted.
The fittings are to be moved to the final housing when I have the proper measurements in hand tp print it.
I have a further motor (with an offset axle) that I accidentally ordered that may also be put to use to raise and lower the projector.
