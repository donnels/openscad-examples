The original lid replacement I printed was needed to hold the existing blasted thing together at all.
The lid is missing a mount for the ugly box it's holding together so that this is probably better than designing a mount.
Right now the electronics just hang around (in the box with a lid) and look and feel ugly (while working).
Did I mention that the original had developed a fault that was solved by re-soldering the 220V side?

The screen uses a 230V 60KTYZ motor (with a centered shaft and 15RPM).
The screen has adjustable end stops that are micro switches that cut the power to either up or down power.
The end stops are activated when the screen axle is rotated and then also moves the stopper left or right along a lead screw attached to the axle.
The electronics just need to provide power for a period x that is longer than from one end stop to the other.
The electronics do NOT know the state of the screen.
Maybe adding a current sense probe or two might help there.... or not worth the trouble.
